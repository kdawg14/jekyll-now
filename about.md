Got into programming and web development back in 6th and 7th grades, and knew pretty well what I was going to do with the rest of my life.  Always figured I'd be a high-level web developer, so of course I went into embedded software development.  Currently working mostly in C#/C++ (Qt) for a public safety company, also taking on DevOps roles and just generally trying to improve my skillset and help my company and my family move forward.  

### More Information

Dad to six amazing kids.  Husband to one amazing woman.

Just starting this blog for fun: partially to learn more about the [Jekyll static blog platform](https://jekyllrb.com/) that runs this blog, partially to fulfill my desire to write and share my thoughts with the world, and partially to see if anyone cares about the things I write.  If at least two of those three turn out to be positive experiences, I'll consider this a success. :)

### Some things that I'm trying to learn more about

- Jekyll
- Javascript frameworks (Aurelia and React at the top of the list)
- Provisioning tools (Saltstack)
- Contributing to open-source projects
